# Customer Churn EDA — Insights

This file contains **detailed insights** gathered from the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process.  
It complements the `CustomerChurn_EDA.ipynb` notebook by summarizing findings in plain language.

---

## 1. Data Overview
- Dataset contains both **numerical** and **categorical** features.
- A few columns included missing values represented as blanks (`' '`) or `NA` tokens.
- No duplicate records were found.

---

## 2. Data Cleaning
- TotalCharges column was found to be with Wrong Data Type (Object instead of Numerical), converted to Numerical.
- Few rows with Missing Values in TotalCharges Column were dropped from Dataset.
- Post-cleaning, dataset was ready for analysis with well-defined types.

**Takeaway:** Clean data ensures reliable insights and avoids skewed analysis.

## 3. Univariate Analysis

### Numerical Features
1) Tenure:
   - U-Shaped Distribution: The histogram is bimodal, with large peaks at both the low end (0-5 months) and the high end (around 70 months). This "U" shape suggests the customer base is polarized: there is a large group of new customers and a large group of very loyal, long-term customers, with fewer customers in the middle range.
   - Wide Spread: The boxplot is very wide, and the median is around 30 months. This confirms that the data is highly spread out, without a single central point where most customers cluster.

Insight: The business is good at attracting new customers and retaining a core group for a very long time. However, there might be a "danger zone" in the middle of the customer lifecycle where customers are more likely to leave.

2) Monthly Charges:
   - Left-Skewed with a Spike: The distribution is generally left-skewed. The most prominent feature is a large spike at the low end, around 20. This indicates a significant number of customers are on a basic or low-cost plan. After this spike, the charges are more spread out, with another, broader peak around 80-100.
   - Higher Median: The boxplot shows that the median monthly charge is relatively high (around $70), despite the large number of low-paying customers. This means that more than half of the customers pay a significant amount per month.

Insight: The customer base seems segmented into at least two groups: a large group on an inexpensive entry-level plan and another substantial group paying for more premium, high-cost services.

3) Total Charges:
   - Strongly Right-Skewed: The histogram shows a classic positive (right) skew. The vast majority of customers have lower total charges, with a long tail of a few customers who have paid a very high amount over their lifetime.
   - Low Median, High Range: The boxplot confirms this skew. The box is compressed at the low end, with a median around 1,400. The long whisker extending to the right indicates that while most customers have lower total charges, the maximum values are very high (over 8,000).

Insight: This pattern is expected. New customers (as seen in the tenure chart) will naturally have low total charges. The high values in the long tail are generated by the loyal, long-tenured customers, especially those with high monthly bills.

### Categorical Features
1) Gender:
- Male and female customers are almost equally represented in the dataset.

2) Partner:
- The count for customers without a partner is slightly higher, but both categories are close in magnitude.

3) Dependents:
- A majority of customers do not have dependents.

- A smaller group, less than half, does have dependents.

4) PhoneService:
- The vast majority of customers have phone service.
- Only a small fraction respond "No," indicating limited interest in customers who do not require phone connections with this provider.

5) MultipleLines:
- More customers do not have multiple phone lines, though a significant number do, showing demand for this add-on.
- Customers without phone service make up a small part of this variable's count.

6) InternetService:
- Fiber optic is the most popular connection type, followed by DSL.
- The "No" category represents customers without internet service, a sizable but minority segment.

7) OnlineSecurity:
- A majority of respondents do not have online security service.
- Those who do are fewer, and a consistent "No internet service" group is present.

8) OnlineBackup:
- As with OnlineSecurity, more customers lack this feature than have it.
- The "No internet service" group consistently forms a smaller portion.

9) DeviceProtection:
- The "No" category is highest for this service, though the "Yes" group is considerable.
- "No internet service" remains a minor but steady group across these features.

10) TechSupport:
- Most customers do not have tech support, as indicated by the highest bar for "No" responses.
- The next largest group includes those who answered "Yes," but it is significantly smaller than the "No" group.
- A notable segment reflects "No internet service," indicating some customers do not require this service at all.

11) StreamingTV:
- The counts of "Yes" and "No" for StreamingTV are very close, suggesting a nearly even split between customers who use the service and those who don't.
- "No internet service" is a smaller category, similar to previous tech-related features.

12) StreamingMovies:
- The usage pattern is like StreamingTV, with "Yes" and "No" responses being nearly equal in count.
- Again, a minority of customers fall into the "No internet service" group, showing a similar trend to other internet-dependent services.

13) Contract:
- Month-to-month contracts are most popular.
- Two-year and one-year contracts trail behind, showing a customer base that prefers flexibility.

14) PaperlessBilling:
- Paperless billing is favored by a majority of customers.
- A substantial portion still opts for paper billing, but they are in the minority.

15) PaymentMethod:
- The "Electronic check" method is most popular for payments.
- The three other methods, "Mailed check," "Bank transfer (automatic)," and "Credit card (automatic)," show almost equal use but are less common individually than electronic checks.

16) Churn:
- Most customers have not churned ("No"), but a significant minority have ("Yes").
- The dataset is imbalanced (~27% churn).

## 4. Bivariate Analysis

### Numerical vs Numerical
1) Heatmap of Correlations:

- Tenure vs TotalCharges: There is a strong positive correlation (0.83), meaning customers with higher tenure tend to have higher total charges.

- MonthlyCharges vs TotalCharges: A moderate positive correlation (0.65) is seen, indicating that higher monthly charges contribute to higher total charges, but not as tightly as tenure does.

- Tenure vs MonthlyCharges: The correlation here (0.25) is weak, meaning the amount a customer pays monthly is not strongly related to how long they've been with the company.

2) Scatter Plot:

- Tenure vs TotalCharges: As tenure increases, total charges also increase, but there is a clear banding structure, likely reflecting payment structure or contract rules.
    
- MonthlyCharges vs TotalCharges: There is a widening triangle pattern: for each level of monthly charges, total charges vary widely but increase overall with higher monthly charges.
  
- Tenure vs MonthlyCharges: No strong trend or correlation. The points are widely dispersed, with tenure values (vertical axis) spread fairly evenly across all MonthlyCharges levels (horizontal axis). There’s no clear increasing or decreasing pattern, confirming a weak or nonexistent correlation. There are vertical stripes, meaning certain MonthlyCharges values are much more common. For each MonthlyCharges value, customer tenure can range from very low (new customers) to quite high (longtime customers).

### Categorical vs Numerical
1) Gender:
- Distribution of tenure, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges is very similar for both Male and Female groups.
- No significant differences are visible, indicating gender does not strongly affect tenure, monthly, or total charges.

2) Partner:
- Customers with and without partners show quite similar distributions for tenure, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges.
- Presence of a partner does not appear to have a pronounced effect on spending or duration.

3) Dependents:
- Customers without dependents have a wider spread and higher upper range in tenure compared to those with dependents.
- Monthly and TotalCharges are only marginally lower for those with dependents; differences are not very large.

4) PhoneService:
- Customers with phone service have a wide spread in tenure and higher TotalCharges, as expected.
- Those without phone service have a narrower distribution for these metrics, reflecting more limited engagement.

5) MultipleLines:
- Those with multiple lines generally have slightly higher Monthly and TotalCharges.
- The group with no phone service stands out for having much lower tenure and charges.

6) InternetService:
- Customers with Fiber optic tend to have higher MonthlyCharges and a larger spread in TotalCharges versus DSL or no internet.
- Tenure is fairly spread across all groups, but charges are much lower when internet service is "No".

7) OnlineSecurity / OnlineBackup / DeviceProtection / TechSupport
- For all these services, the "No internet service" group consistently has the lowest charges and shortest tenure.
- Customers who have added these services might have slightly higher MonthlyCharges and possibly higher median tenure than those who do not.

8) StreamingTV / StreamingMovies:
- Subscribers to streaming services have higher MonthlyCharges and wider TotalCharges distributions versus non-subscribers.
- "No internet service" groups again have the lowest spending and tenure.

9) Contract:
- Customers on one- or two-year contracts have much higher tenure and TotalCharges, as expected.
- Month-to-month contracts show much lower tenure and lower total accumulation of charges.

10) PaperlessBilling:
- Customers who prefer paperless billing have a wider spread (and sometimes higher) MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges.
- Tenure differences are small; billing preference has more effect on charge distributions than on loyalty.

11) PaymentMethod:
- No single payment method results in drastically different tenure, but "Electronic check" users have a slightly wider spread in MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges.
- Other payment types, including automatic bank or credit card transfers, show similar distributions.

12) Churn:
- Customers who have churned have lower tenure by definition, and a wide range of monthly and total charges.
- Non-churned customers show a large spread and higher median values for tenure and TotalCharges.

## 5. Multivariate Analysis (PCA)
- A few (First two) **principal components explained most of the variance** in the dataset.
- PCA visualization suggested natural **customer groupings** based on services and charges.

---

## 6. Statistical Tests:
- Chi-Square Test: According to Chi_Squared Test Analysis, Churn Depends Significantlly on these Categorical Features:

    - Partner
    - Dependents
    - MultipleLines
    - InternetService
    - OnlineSecurity
    - OnlineBackup
    - DeviceProtection
    - TechSupport
    - StreamingTV
    - StreamingMovies
    - Contract
    - PaperlessBilling
    - PaymentMethod.

- T Test: All the Numerical Features Differes Significanylly Between Churned and Not-Churned Groups.

## 7. Overall Business Insights
- I noticed customers in the middle range of tenure seem to leave more. Maybe the company can try some offers or rewards for people around 6–24 months so they don’t drop out.
- Most people are on month-to-month contracts, and churn is higher there. If the company gives some small discounts or benefits for yearly contracts, it might keep customers longer.
- Customers with higher monthly charges seem to churn more. Maybe giving them better value or flexible plans could help.
- Add-on services like Online Security, Backup, and Tech Support are linked with lower churn. It might be good to promote these together as bundles.
- Many new customers leave quickly (low tenure). So better onboarding, like welcome guides or early support, could help them stick around.
- Payment method also matters. I saw that people using electronic checks churn more. If the company motivates them to use auto-pay (credit card or bank), churn might reduce.
- Fiber optic users pay more and seem more engaged. Maybe DSL customers can be encouraged to upgrade to fiber with some offers.
- Customers with dependents or multiple lines may behave differently. The company can think about family or group plans for them.
- Streaming users pay more but also churn sometimes. Maybe giving them special streaming bundles or free trials could keep them happy.
- Many don’t have tech support, and churn is higher for them. Even a basic free support option could make them feel more cared for.
